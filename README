This is a tool to help me learn Swedish.

There are two "boxes": a dictionary mapping the Swedish bits I learn day-by-day
in Sweden to English expressions, and an array for grammatical notes and fun
facts.

The idea is to make it searchable and available in the web someday.

UPDATE

I'm now using Anki and Learning With Texts to learn Swedish. It's a very
effective way, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a new
language. This repository will not be updated further, as I have imported my
vocabulary into Anki decks and my sentences into a LWT text to review.

Ha det bra!
